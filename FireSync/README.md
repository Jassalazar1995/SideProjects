- Customizable profiles for each user, containing relevant information and preferences.

### 2. Interactive Scheduling Interface
- An intuitive drag-and-drop interface for creating and modifying schedules.
- Support for different views (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) to aid in comprehensive schedule planning.

### 3. Real-Time Notifications
- Automated notifications (via email, SMS, or in-app) to inform employees about their schedules and any updates or changes.
- Reminder notifications for upcoming shifts or deadlines.

### 4. Conflict Detection and Resolution
- Built-in algorithms to detect scheduling conflicts (e.g., double-booking, overbooking) and suggest solutions.
- Tools for managers to easily resolve conflicts and adjust schedules as needed.

### 5. Shift Swaps and Volunteering
- Functionality for employees to post and accept shift swaps, subject to manager approval.
- A system for employees to volunteer for open shifts or additional hours.

### 6. Reporting and Analytics
